## Enhanced Calibration System

The app now features an advanced calibration system that ensures accurate throttle readings:

### Calibration Process

1. **Start**: App sends calibration start command to ESP32
2. **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time updates showing visit counts to min/max positions
3. **Stability Validation**: ESP32 ensures readings are consistent before accepting
4. **Completion Detection**: App automatically detects when calibration is complete
5. **Status Updates**: Real-time feedback during the entire process

### Calibration Features

- **Multi-position validation**: Requires multiple visits to min/max positions
- **Stability checking**: Ensures readings are consistent before saving
- **Time-based validation**: Prevents immediate saving for better accuracy
- **Progress visualization**: Clear feedback showing current progress
- **Automatic completion**: No manual intervention required

## BLE Protocol

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- Ensure Bluetooth is enabled on your device
- Verify the ESP32 device is advertising with name "ABurner"
- Check that the ESP32 firmware is running and BLE service is active
- Grant location permissions (required for BLE scanning on Android)

### Calibration Issues

- **Move throttle slowly**: Ensure stable readings at min/max positions
- **Multiple visits**: Visit each position multiple times for validation
- **Check progress**: Monitor the calibration progress in the app
- **Reset if needed**: Use reset calibration if process gets stuck

### Permission Issues

- On Android 12+, ensure "Nearby Devices" permission is granted
- On iOS, ensure Bluetooth permissions are granted in Settings

### Build Issues

- Clean and rebuild: `npx react-native clean`
- Reset Metro cache: `npx react-native start --reset-cache`

### Debug Information

- **App Logs**: Only critical error information is logged
- **BLE Status**: Real-time connection and calibration status
- **Calibration Progress**: Visual feedback during calibration process
