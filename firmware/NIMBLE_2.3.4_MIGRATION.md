# NimBLE-Arduino 2.3.4 Migration Guide

This document outlines the changes made to migrate the Afterburner project from NimBLE-Arduino 1.4.3 to 2.3.4.

## Overview

The migration was successful and the project now uses NimBLE-Arduino 2.3.4, which provides improved performance, better resource management, and enhanced stability compared to the previous version.

## Changes Made

### 1. PlatformIO Configuration (`platformio.ini`)

**Updated dependency version:**

```ini
# Before
h2zero/NimBLE-Arduino@^1.4.3

# After
h2zero/NimBLE-Arduino@^2.3.4
```

### 2. BLE Service Header (`src/ble_service.h`)

**Added missing include:**

```cpp
#include <NimBLEAdvertising.h>
```

### 3. BLE Service Implementation (`src/ble_service.cpp`)

#### 3.1 Callback Signature Updates

All characteristic callback classes were updated to include the new `NimBLEConnInfo& connInfo` parameter:

**Before:**

```cpp
void onWrite(NimBLECharacteristic* pCharacteristic) {
    bleService->handleModeWrite(pCharacteristic);
}
```

**After:**

```cpp
void onWrite(NimBLECharacteristic* pCharacteristic, NimBLEConnInfo& connInfo) {
    bleService->handleModeWrite(pCharacteristic);
}
```

This change was applied to all callback classes:

- `ModeCharacteristicCallbacks`
- `StartColorCharacteristicCallbacks`
- `EndColorCharacteristicCallbacks`
- `SpeedMsCharacteristicCallbacks`
- `BrightnessCharacteristicCallbacks`
- `NumLedsCharacteristicCallbacks`
- `AbThresholdCharacteristicCallbacks`
- `SavePresetCharacteristicCallbacks`

#### 3.2 Advertising Configuration Updates

**Before:**

```cpp
pAdvertising->setMinPreferred(0x06);
pAdvertising->setMinPreferred(0x12);
pAdvertising->setScanResponse(true);
```

**After:**

```cpp
pAdvertising->setMinInterval(0x06);
pAdvertising->setMaxInterval(0x12);
// Removed setScanResponse(true) - scan response is enabled by default in 2.x
```

## Key Benefits of NimBLE 2.3.4

1. **Improved Performance**: Better resource utilization and faster BLE operations
2. **Enhanced Stability**: More reliable connections and reduced memory usage
3. **Better Compatibility**: Improved compatibility with modern BLE devices
4. **Active Development**: Ongoing maintenance and updates from the NimBLE community

## Build Results

The migration was successful with both build environments:

- `esp32dev`: ✅ SUCCESS
- `esp32dev_test`: ✅ SUCCESS

**Memory Usage:**

- RAM: 11.7% (38,408 bytes from 327,680 bytes)
- Flash: 51.1% (669,309 bytes from 1,310,720 bytes)

## Testing

The project builds successfully and maintains all existing functionality:

- BLE service creation and advertising
- Characteristic read/write operations
- Status notifications
- Settings management
- LED effects and throttle reading

## Notes

- The migration maintains backward compatibility with existing BLE clients
- All existing functionality remains unchanged
- No changes were required to the React Native mobile app
- The project is now using the latest stable version of NimBLE-Arduino
